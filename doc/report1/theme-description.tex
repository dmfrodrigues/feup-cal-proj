\chapter{Theme description}
The company \emph{PortoCityTransfers} provides shuttle services beetween Campanh√£ railway station (Porto, Portugal) and hotels/other places in the Porto region (municipalities of Porto, Matosinhos, Maia, Vila Nova de Gaia). For that end, it owns a certain number of vans, which can transport a given number of passangers each. Service reservation must be made via Internet, where clients can indicate their estimated time of arrival and final destination. Given a set of service requests to satisfy in a given day, and their respective destinations, the company must group passangers and plan routes for that day, having in mind passangers should wait for a period as short as possible.\par
This project will design and implement a computer system that will allow \emph{PortoCityTransfers} to plan its routes. The following iterations should be considered for project development:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The company owns a single van.
    \item The company owns several vans, where multiple travels are simultaneously possible for different vans.
    \item Passangers without reservation must be accounted for, as well as passangers that wish to travel from their homes to the train station.
\end{enumerate}
