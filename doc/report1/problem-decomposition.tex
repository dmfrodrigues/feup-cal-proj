\chapter{Problem decomposition} \label{problem-decomposition}
After having formally presented the general problem, we will decompose it into successively smaller, well-known (and preferably classical) problems for each iteration, and present solutions personalized for each iteration.

\section{Iterations} \label{problem-decomposition-iterations}
\subsection{Iteration I}
The company owns one van, and thus can not leave the train station for too long. However, it must also serve the clients that are ready to travel and that are waiting for the van to start its travel.\par
We will use the first iteration to test our algorithms, therefore reducing the need for finding near-optimal heuristics for the hardest problems that will eventually be made harder in subsequent iterations.\par
One minor heuristic we can implement to group clients is described in section \ref{algorithm-vrp-heuristic}. Having grouped clients, we now need to solve a problem similar to the Travelling Salesman Problem.\par

\section{Path-finding} \label{problem-decomposition-pathfinding}
We will take advantage of the hierarchical difference between $G$ and $G'$ to make path-finding faster.\par
Since $G'$ is not too large, we can pre-calculate distances between all pairs of nodes in $G'$.
Then, all we have to do is find the two nodes on the ends of the origin's street, and the two nodes on the ends of the destination's street, and try out all the four possibilities.
\section{Travelling salesman problem} \label{problem-decomposition-tsp}
Our particular instance of the travelling salesman problem is very similar to the classical version. This problem is more thoroughly described in section \ref{algorithm-tsp}.
\section{Vehicle routing problem} \label{problem-decomposition-vrp}
Known strategies for the vehicle routing problem offer case-specific solutions taking into account the particular problem's constraints. This problem is more thoroughly described in section \ref{algorithm-vrp}.
