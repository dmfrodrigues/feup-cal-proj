\chapter{Problem decomposition}
After having formally presented the general problem, we will decompose it into successively smaller, well-known (and preferably classical) problems for each iteration, and present solutions personalized for each iteration.
\section{Iteration I}
The company owns one van, and thus can not leave the train station for too long. One minor heuristic we can implement for this case is: after welcoming its first client, the van $v$ will wait to welcome all clients arriving in the following $\Delta t$ minutes (or the first $v.n$ client, whichever happens first). !DO
