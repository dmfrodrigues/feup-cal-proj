\chapter{Use cases} \label{use-cases}
Our program should allow a user to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Visualize the road network, placing nodes in their correct geographical position and displaying speed limits in a graphical way, using the suggested tool \href{https://github.com/STEMS-group/GraphViewer}{GraphViewer} or another visualization tool if necessary.
    \item Visualize the \acrshort{SCC} of the train station.
    \item Find the shortest path from one node to another.
    \item Given a list of vans and services for a day, find the set of routes for that day.
\end{itemize}
