    \item Visualize the road network, placing nodes in their correct geographical position and displaying speed limits in a graphical way.
    \item Visualize the SCC of the train station.
    \item Find the shortest path from one node to another.
    \item Given a list of vans and services for a day, find the set of routes for that day.
