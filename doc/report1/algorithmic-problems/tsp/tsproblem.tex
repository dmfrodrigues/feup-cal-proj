\section{\texorpdfstring{\Acrlong*{TSP}}{Travelling salesman problem}} \label{algorithm-tsp}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Summary:} Given a set of nodes and the cost of going from any node to any other node, find the least cost path that crosses all nodes, starting and ending in a source node. 
    \item \textbf{Input:} Set of nodes $V$, cost function $w: \mathscr{P}(V) \times V^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ and origin $s \in V$, where $w=w(S, u, v)$ depends on the visited cities $S$, origin $u$ and destination $v$.
    \item \textbf{Output:} Path $p$ in $G$, starting and ending in $s$ and passing through all nodes.
    \item \textbf{Objective function:} $W(p)~\min$.
\end{itemize}
A variant of this problem is the decision version of the \acrshort*{TSP}, which is formulated as ``is there a path crossing all nodes with cost less than $z$?'', which is NP-complete since a witness in the form of the actual path can be checked to have a cost less or equal to $z$ in linear time.
The general \acrshort*{TSP} is a strict NP-hard problem, since given a solution there is no known algorithm that can check if that solution is optimal (that would actually be as hard as finding the solution itself).\par
However, the rational \acrshort*{TSP} (all edges and solutions are rational) is NP-complete, since it can be converted into an integer \acrshort*{TSP} (where all edges and solutions are integers), which can itself be transformed into the decision version of the \acrshort*{TSP} with an extra step searching the least $z$ for which the decision problem returns \emph{yes}, starting at some finite upper bound that can be easily obtained (this extra section could be a linear search or a binary search, for instance).\par
This does not justify by any means that these instances of the \acrshort*{TSP} are particularly easy to solve; in fact, almost all instances of the \acrshort*{TSP} are pretty hard to solve, and there is no known polynomial-time algorithm capable of solving any of these problems.
