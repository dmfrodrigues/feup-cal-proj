\subsection{Nearest neighbour algorithm} \label{algorithm-tsp-nn}
% Comment do Diogo (esclarecer o que Ã© que ele queria dizer com isto) -> Heuristic
The Nearest Neighbour (NN) algorithm corresponds to a simple to understand constructive heuristic method that attempts to solve the travelling salesman problem.\par
Starting by an empty solution, it chooses a random city which will be the starting point $s$. At each step builds upon the previous iteration, visiting the nearest city and adding it to the solution until all the cities have been visited, at which point in time all that is left is to return to the start city.\par

% doubt: does it connect the last visited to the start city or goes the path backwards?
