\subsection{Kosaraju's algorithm} \label{algorithm-scc-kosaraju}
Kosaraju's algorithm was first sugested by Sambasiva Rao Kosaraju in 1978, but only published in 1981 by Micha Sharir \cite{sharir81}, independently. It makes use of the following lemma:
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:kosaraju1}
    Let $C$ and $C'$ be distinct strongly connected components in directed graph $G=(V,E)$, let $u,v \in C$, let $u',v' \in C'$, and suppose that G contains a path $u \leadsto u'$. Then G cannot also contain a path $v \leadsto v'$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    If $v \leadsto v'$, then $u \leadsto u' \leadsto v'$ and $v' \leadsto v \leadsto u$ exist. Thus, $u$ and $v'$ are reachable from each other, thereby contradicting the assumption that $C$ and $C'$ are distinct strongly connected components.
\end{proof}
