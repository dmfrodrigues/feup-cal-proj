\subsection{Optimal solution} \label{algorithm-vrp-optimal}
Like the \acrshort*{TSP}, the general \acrshort*{VRP} is a strict NP-hard problem but the integer \acrshort*{VRP} is NP-complete; this means that, to this date, an optimal solution will necessarily be at least superpolynomial. In our case, it implies at least to inspect all partitions of the set of clients. We will not go into much detail about this solution because, no matter what algorithm we use to solve the underlying \acrshort*{TSP}, we will not be able to return a solution within a decent time limit taking into account our datasets are relatively large.
