\subsection{Optimal solution} \label{algorithm-vrp-optimal}
Like the \acrshort*{TSP}, the \acrshort*{VRP} is an NP-complete problem, meaning an optimal solution will necessarily be exponential in at least $N$. In our case, it implies at least to inspect all partitions of the set of clients. We will not go into much detail about this solution because, no matter what algorithm we use to solve the underlying \acrshort*{TSP}, we will not be able to return a solution within a decent time limit taking into account our datasets are relatively large.
