\subsection{A simple heuristic} \label{algorithm-vrp-heuristic}
A simple, \gls{constructive} heuristic algorithm we can initially implement consists of: after welcoming its first client, the van $v$ will wait to welcome all clients arriving in the following $\Delta t$ minutes (or the first $v.n$ client, whichever happens first), which must be a relatively small time interval to avoid long waiting times. We estimate the suitable time interval to be a fifth of the approximate maximum round-trip in the served area. Using the approximate maximum round-trip:
\begin{alignat*}{5}
    \text{Campanhã, Porto}
    &\rightarrow \text{Folgosa, Maia (17min)} \\
    &\rightarrow\text{Angeiras, Matosinhos (23min)} \\
    &\rightarrow\text{São Félix da Marinha, Vila Nova de Gaia (33min)} \\
    &\rightarrow\text{Balteiro, Vila Nova de Gaia (14min)} \\
    &\rightarrow\text{Campanhã, Porto (9min)}
\end{alignat*}
which totals to 96min, taking a fifth of that would yield approximately $\Delta t = 20min$ (during implementation and testing we will evidently revisit this value and evaluate potentially better values).
