\section{\texorpdfstring{\Acrlong*{VRP}}{Vehicle routing problem}} \label{algorithm-vrp}
The vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is an optimization problem whose goal is to find the optimal routes between goods or people while taking into account constraints specific to the issue to solve (such as customer satisfaction),
being related with the TSP.

In this problem, we only deal with client partitioning among routes, thus delegating the task of finding the cost of a partition to a \acrshort{TSP} algorithm.\par
