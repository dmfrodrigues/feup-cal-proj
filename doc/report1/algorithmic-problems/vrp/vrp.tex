\section{\texorpdfstring{\Acrlong*{VRP}}{Vehicle routing problem}} \label{algorithm-vrp}
In this problem, we only deal with client partitioning among routes, thus delegating the task of finding the cost of a partition to a \acrshort{TSP} algorithm.\par
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Summary:} Given a set of clients and vans, partition the clients and assign each partition to a van so as to minimize a cost function.
    \item \textbf{Input:} Clients $C$, vans $V$, cost function $W\colon \mathbb{P}_C \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $.
    \item \textbf{Output:} Partition $P \in \mathbb{P}_C$ and function $v\colon P \rightarrow V$.
    \item \textbf{Objective function:} $W(P)~\min$.
\end{itemize}
The \acrfull*{VRP} is an optimization problem whose goal is to find the optimal routes between goods or people while taking into account constraints specific to the issue to solve (such as customer satisfaction). It is a generalization of the \acrshort{TSP}.
