\subsection{Depth-first search}
Depth-first search is a very elementary graph traversal, which explores nodes in depth before backtracking.

\subsubsection{Proof of correctness}
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:dfs}
    If $u$ is reachable from $s$ and $v$ is adjacent to $u$, then $v$ is reachable from $s$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    If $u$ is reachable from $s$, then $\exists p \in P(G) \colon p_0 = s \wedge p_k = u$. Let that path be $p^u$. If $v$ is adjacent to $u$ then $(u,v) \in E$. We can thus add $v$ to the end of path $p^u$, which will either be a valid path, or an invalid path which means $v$ was already in $p^u$ in position $j$, implying $p^u[0:j]$ is a path from $s$ to $v$.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
    Depth-first search algorithm starting in $s$ finds all nodes reachable from $s$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} \textbf{Base case:} $u=s$; $s$ is trivially reachable from itself. \\
\textbf{Inductive step:} suppose \textsc{DFS} is always called for a node $u$ reachable from $s$. By lemma \ref{lem:dfs} we know all nodes adjacent to $u$ are reachable from $s$. Since \textsc{DFS} is only called for the nodes adjacent to $u$ the inductive implication holds.\par
We have thus proven the theorem correct by induction.
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Complexity analysis}
Each node is explored once, and for each node all its adjacent nodes are explored via all edges. All elementary operations are $O(1)$, making this algorithm run in time $O(|E|+|V|)$.\par
In terms of memory, each call takes $O(1)$ and the call chain can be the same size as $|V|$ (one call per node). This means the algorithm uses $O(|V|)$ memory.
