\subsection{Floyd-Warshall algorithm} \label{algorithm-shortestpath-floydwarshall}
The Floyd-Warshall's algorithm also knows as Floyd's algorithm was published in 1962 is a generalization of Warshall's algorithm 
(which only tested the existence of a path between two vertexes) and corresponds to a dynamic programming method 
that finds the shortest path between each pair of vertices in a graph (whose edges' weights may be not only positive but also negative).

\subsubsection{Proof of correctness}

\subsubsection{Complexity analysis}
By comparing every path of the graph between each pair of vertices, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm detains a time complexity in the order of $\Theta(|V|^3)$ due not only to the three nested $for$ loops but also to the $O(1)$ run time of line 11.\par
When it comes to memory expenditure, by creating k matrices, one for each iteration of the k for loop, it takes up $\Theta(|V|^3)$ which can be reduced to $\Theta(|V|^2)$ if instead of creating a new matrix, the existing one is updated.

\subsubsection{Remarks}
Even though the Floyd-Warshall's algorithm functions correctly with negative weight edges, being able also to detect negative cycles, these features won't most likely be of much use, due to the nature of the problem:
the time it takes to get from one location to another must be a value equal to (in the case of the "current position" being equal to the "final position") or greater than zero.
