\subsection{Floyd-Warshall algorithm} \label{algorithm-shortestpath-floydwarshall}
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm was published in 1962 as a generalization of Warshall's algorithm 
(which only tested the existence of a path between two vertices \cite[p.~346]{floyd-alg}). It applies a dynamic programming approach 
to find the shortest path between each pair of vertices in a graph (whose edges' weights may be not only positive but also negative).\par
To simplify, consider each vertex in $V$ is identified by a unique integer $1 \leq i \leq |V|$.
Let $dist(i, j)^{(k)}$ be the cost of the shortest path from $i$ to $j$ that resorts to vertices $1, 2, ..., k$.
This algorithm follows the following recurrence \cite[p.~694]{intro-alg}:

\begin{equation}
    dist(i,j)^{(k)}=\begin{dcases}
        \infty                                                         &: k=0 \wedge (i,j) \not \in E \\
        w(i,j)                                                         &: k=0 \wedge (i,j) \in E\\
        \min\{dist(i,j)^{(k-1)}, dist(i,k)^{(k-1)} + dist(k,j)^{(k-1)}\}, &: k \geq 1
    \end{dcases}
\end{equation}

The base case corresponds to $k=0$ where $dist(i, j)^{(0)}$ is the value of the edge if it exists (or $\infty$ otherwise) that connects those two vertices.
Otherwise, the length of the shortest path from $i$ to $j$ is the least of the length of the path without considering the vertex labeled as $k$,
or the length of the shortest path from $i$ to $j$ via $k$ (i.e., from $i$ to $k$ and from $k$ to $j$).\par

\subsubsection{Complexity analysis}
By comparing every path of the graph between each pair of vertices, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm detains a time complexity in the order of $\Theta(|V|^3)$ due not only to the three nested $for$ loops but also to the $O(1)$ run time of line 11.\par
When it comes to memory expenditure, by creating k matrices, one for each iteration of the k for loop, it takes up $\Theta(|V|^3)$ which may possibly be reduced to $\Theta(|V|^2)$ if instead of creating a new matrix, the existing one is updated.

\subsubsection{Remarks}
Even though the Floyd-Warshall's algorithm functions correctly with negative weight edges, these features will most likely not be of much use, due to the nature of the problem:
the time it takes to get from one location to another must be a value equal to (in the case of the ``current position" being equal to the ``final position") or greater than zero.
