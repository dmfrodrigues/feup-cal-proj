\subsection{Floyd-Warshall algorithm} \label{algorithm-shortestpath-floydwarshall}
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm was published in 1962 as a generalization of Warshall's algorithm for the \hyperref[def:desc]{transitive closure} \cite[p.~346]{floyd-alg}. It is a \gls{recursive} algorithm that applies a \gls{dynamic programming} approach 
to find the shortest path between each pair of vertices in a graph, even if edges have negative weights.\par
Consider each vertex in $V$ is identified by a unique integer $1 \leq i \leq |V|$.
Let $dist(i, j)^{(k)}$ be the cost of the shortest path from $i$ to $j$ using vertices $1, 2, ..., k$.
This algorithm follows the recurrence adapted from \cite{intro-alg}:

\begin{equation}
    dist(i,j)^{(k)}=\begin{dcases}
        0                                                                &: i=j \\
        \infty                                                           &: k=0 \wedge (i,j) \not \in E \\
        w(i,j)                                                           &: k=0 \wedge (i,j) \in E\\
        \min\{dist(i,j)^{(k-1)}, dist(i,k)^{(k-1)} + dist(k,j)^{(k-1)}\} &: k \geq 1
    \end{dcases}
\end{equation}

The base cases are $k=0$, where $dist(i, j)^{(0)}$ is the value of the edge from $i$ to $j$ if it exists (or $\infty$ otherwise).
Otherwise, the length of the shortest path from $i$ to $j$ is the least of the length of the path without considering the vertex labeled as $k$,
or the length of the shortest path from $i$ to $j$ via $k$ (i.e., from $i$ to $k$ and from $k$ to $j$).\par

\subsubsection{Complexity analysis}
By comparing every path of the graph between each pair of vertices, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm has a time complexity of $O(|V|^3)$ due not only to the three nested \textbf{for} loops but also to the fact all elementary operations having $O(1)$ run time.\par
When it comes to memory, by creating $k$ matrices, one for each iteration of the outer-most \textbf{for} loop, it takes up $O(|V|^3)$. This can be reduced to $O(|V|^2)$ if, on processing $dist^{(k)}$, we only hold $dist^{(k-1)}$. We can even halve it by always updating the same matrix, making the previous matrix unnecessary.

\subsubsection{Remarks}
The added flexibility of working with negative-weight edges is not particularly useful in our case, since the time it takes to travel between two places must be non-negative. Besides, Dijkstra's algorithm can produce the same result in time $O(|V|(|E|+|V|)\log {|V|})$, or $O(|V|^2 \log |V|)$ if the graph is sparse as is the case.
