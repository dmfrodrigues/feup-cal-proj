\subsection{Dijkstra's algorithm} \label{algorithm-shortestpath-dijkstra}
Dijkstra's algorithm is one of the most famous graph algorithms, and the most popular shortest path algorithm. It was first published in 1959 by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra \cite{dijkstra}. This algorithm finds the distance between $s$ and every other node $d \colon s \leadsto d$ (thus solving all shortest path problems from $s$).\par
The fundamental idea is that, at each moment, we hold a set $Q$ of unprocessed nodes, and we know for all nodes $u$ the least distance $dist(u)$ from $s$ to $u$ and previous node $prev(u)$ in the shortest path (temporary if $u \in Q$, final otherwise). We then extract the node $u \in Q$ with the least distance to $s$, and process it by iterating over all adjacent nodes, calculating their potential new distance $c'$ to $s$ via $u$, and if $c'$ is smaller we update $dist(v)=c'$ and $prev(v)=u$.\par

                \For {$v \in \Call{Adj}{G, u}$}
                    \State $c' \gets dist(u) + w(u, v)$
                    \If {$c' < dist(v)$}
                        \State{ $dist(v) \gets c'$, $prev(v) \gets u$}
                    \EndIf
                \EndFor

To achieve the least time complexity, the graph is usually represented as an adjacency list $Adj$, and $Q$ is a minimum priority queue.
\subsubsection{Proof of correctness} \label{sec:dijkstra-PoC}
The full proof is rather long and is promptly available (for instance, in \cite[p.~659]{intro-alg}), thus we will only present a short argument for correctness based on cycle invariants/variants for the \textbf{while} loop.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pre-conditions:} $G(V, E, w)$ is a graph. $s \in V$. $Q$ contains all nodes. $dist(s)=0$ and $prev(s)=\text{NULL}$
    \item \textbf{Post-conditions:} $dist(u)$ and $prev(u)$ from $s$ to $\forall u \in V$ are final. Distance of unreachable nodes is $\infty$ and previous node in shortest path is NULL. $prev(s)$ is also NULL.\par
    \item \textbf{Cycle invariant:} $\forall u \not \in Q$, $dist(u)$ and $prev(u)$ are final. $\forall u \in Q$, $dist(u)$ is the least distance from $s$ to $u$ going only through nodes not in $Q$.\par
    This holds for the next cycle run because the element $u$ we remove from $Q$ already has the least $dist(u)$ passing through nodes $u' \not \in Q$, and it can't pass through nodes $u' \in Q$ because there is no node with less $dist(u')$ that would allow to reduce $dist(u)$ even further.
    \item \textbf{Cycle variant:} $|Q|$, which, being a size, is obviously integer. It is strictly decreasing, given that one node is removed from $Q$ for every cycle run. It is also always positive, given it starts with value $|V|$ where $V$ has at least node $s$. The cycle breaks when $|Q| = 0$.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Complexity analysis}
Let $Q$ be a minimum priority queue, where the following should be considered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To add a node $v$ to $Q$, we call $Q.\textsc{Insert\_With\_Key}(v, dist(v))$ to add it with priority $dist(v)$.
    \item To get the vertex of $Q$ with least $dist(v)$, we call $u \gets Q.\textsc{Extract\_Min}()$ to extract $u$ from $Q$. Let \textsc{Extract\_Min} have time complexity $O(\text{T}_{em})$.
    \item When changing $dist(v)$ in the main cycle, we also call $Q.\textsc{Decrease\_Key}(v, dist(v))$ to decrease its priority in $Q$. Let \textsc{Decrease\_Key} have time complexity $O(\text{T}_{dk})$.
\end{itemize}
All the insertions at the beginning are made in time $O(|V|)$, given all keys are $\infty$ and the heap property is maintained. In the main cycle, all elementary operations are done in $O(1)$ except \textsc{Extract\_Min} and \textsc{Decrease\_Key}. \textsc{Extract\_Min} is run once for each of the $|V|$ nodes we remove from $Q$. For each node $u$ we iterate over $Adj[u]$, thus iterating once over each of the $|E|$ edges, potentially running \textsc{Decrease\_Key} for each edge. This yields the total time complexity $O(|E|\cdot \text{T}_{dk}+|V|\cdot \text{T}_{em})$. \par
Implementing $Q$ as a binary heap, we have $O(\text{T}_{dk})=O(\log |V|)$ and $O(\text{T}_{em})=O(\log |V|)$, thus yielding the total time complexity $O((|E|+|V|)\log |V|)$. This can be further improved with a Fibonacci heap, with $O(\text{T}_{dk})=O(1)$ and $O(\text{T}_{em})=O(\log |V|)$ (both amortized), thus yielding $O(|E| + |V|\log |V|)$.\par
The algorithm takes as much memory as the heaps, thus giving a memory complexity of $O(|V|)$.
\subsubsection{Remarks} \label{alg:dijkstra-early-stop}
Although it has the same complexity, we can make an early stop if we are only looking for the shortest path between two nodes, thus reducing execution time to a significantly smaller fraction.
