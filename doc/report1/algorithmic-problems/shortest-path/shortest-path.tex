\section{Shortest path} \label{algorithm-shortestpath}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Summary:} Given a directed weighted graph, find the path with least cost from one node to another.
    \item \textbf{Input:} Graph $G(V,E,w)$ and origin/destination nodes $s, d \in V$.
    \item \textbf{Output:} Path $p \in P_G$, starting in $s$ and ending in $d$.
    \item \textbf{Objective function:} $\min W(p)$.
\end{itemize}
It is trivial that $G$ can not have negative-weight cycles, otherwise there is not a finite set of shortest paths from $u$ to $v$, since we could always further reduce the weight by traversing the cycle once again.
