\chapter{Graph connectivity} \label{connectivity-graphs}
During a first visual inspection of the graphs it was obvious that not every road  would be able to reach the train station, being the pre-processing of the graphs a necessity.
For this effect, we used the \hyperref[algorithm-scc-kosaraju-v]{Variant of the Kosaraju algorithm} that was mentioned in the Algorithmic Problems chapter, which we thought to be the most reliable option.
Using the method getConnectedGraph (MapGraph.cpp) that applies to the original graph this processing, we obtain a graph that is made up of 209872 nodes, which is a decrease close to 2 per cent of the number of nodes when comparing to the  213367 that the graph returned by getFullGraph (MapGraph.cpp) has.
