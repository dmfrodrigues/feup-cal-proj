\chapter{Graph connectivity} \label{connectivity-graphs}
On visual inspection of the graph, it was obvious that not every node would be reachable from the trains station, making graph pre-processing a necessity to remove unreachable nodes.\par
For this effect, we used the \hyperref[algorithm-scc-kosaraju-v]{variant of Kosaraju's algorithm}, which we considered to be the most reliable option, both because its complexity was equivalent to other \acrshort{SCC} algorithm alternatives and also since its simple implementation left no doubt about its correct implementation.\par
Using method \texttt{MapGraph::getConnectedGraph} (\texttt{MapGraph.cpp}), we applied this processing to the full graph, obtaining a connected graph with $209872$ nodes (a reduction of $1.64\%$ when compared to $213367$ nodes in the full graph) and $386249$ edges (a reduction of $1.21\%$ from originally $390983$ edges), a significant improvement from the full graph obtained from \texttt{MapGraph::getFullGraph} (\texttt{MapGraph.cpp}), and a very important stage to avoid unreachability problems.
