\chapter{Project iterations} \label{iterations}

All iterations work in four fundamentally independent stages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Get the \textbf{connected graph}.
    \item For each client coordinate, find the \textbf{closest node}.
    \item \label{itm:iterations-3} Find the \textbf{shortest paths} betwee all pairs of interesting nodes (train station and all nodes where clients need to be picked up).
    \item Solve an instance of the \textbf{\acrlong*{TSP}}.
\end{enumerate}

In the end, results are printed to a file, which should be named with the extension \texttt{.rides}.
Let $C$ be the number of clients, and let $N$ be the maximum van capacity.

\section{Iteration I} \label{iterations-1}
This iteration starts by processing the ``full" graph in order to get its ``connected version". This pre-processing is achieved by applying the \hyperref[algorithm-scc-kosaraju-v]{variant of Kosaraju's algorithm} which has a time complexity of $O(|E| + |V|)$.\par
We then find for each client the closest node in the connected graph, using the \hyperref[algorithm-vstripes]{vertical stripes algorithm}, which is initialized once in time $O(\Delta x / \Delta + |V| \log |V|)$. In our case, we used $\Delta = 0.025\degree$, and since $\Delta x = 0.25\degree$ the first term is constant and neglibible, thus the time complexity is actually $O(|V| \log |V|)$. To perform the $C$ queries (one for each client), one needs time $O(C \log |V|)$.\par
Afterwards, several instances of \hyperref[algorithm-shortestpath-dijkstra]{Dijkstra's algorithm} are run in paralell to get the length of the shortest paths between all clients' destinations and the station, taking advantage of multithread architectures (using as many threads as detected by \texttt{std::thread::hardware\_concurrency()}). This algorithm runs for all clients in time $O(C(|E|+|V|) \log |V|)$, with a reduction of around 6 times in execution time using several threads. We have also implemented Dijkstra's algorithm using a Fibonacci heap (namely, the \href{https://www.boost.org/}{Boost} library class \href{https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/doc/html/boost/heap/fibonacci_heap.html}{\texttt{fibonacci\_heap}}) instead of a binary heap, but since we were actually getting an increase of execution time by a factor of approximately $2$ (probably due to excessive clutter code in the implementation of \texttt{fibonacci\_heap}, added to the fact our graph is sparse implies $O(|V|)=O(|E|)$ so there is no actual improvement in terms of complexity), we decided to stick to a binary heap and use some compilation flags that would provide us with some extra speed, such as \texttt{-Ofast}.
\par
In the end, we used the \hyperref[algorithm-vrp-heuristic]{simple \acrshort*{VRP} heuristic} which has a time complexity of $O(C \cdot \text{T}_\text{TSP})$ (where $\text{T}_\text{TSP}$ is the complexity of the \acrshort{TSP} algorithm we choose to solve the problem), and to find the optimal solution for each \acrshort{TSP} sub-problem we used the \hyperref[algorithm-tsp-heldkarp]{Held-Karp algorithm}, which has a complexity of $O(N^2 2^N)$, thus yielding a total time complexity of $O(C N^2 2^N)$ for this stage.\par

Globally, this iteration has a total time complexity of $O(C(|E|+|V|) \log |V| + C N^2 2^N)$, where the path-finding stage is clearly the largest contributor to the total time complexity, given $N \leq 16$ is still manageable by the Held-Karp algorithm.
\section{Iteration II} \label{iterations-2}
Iteration II is fundamentally similar to iteration I, but instead of using the Held-Karp algorithm to solve the \acrshort{TSP} sub-problems we used the \hyperref[algorithm-tsp-nn]{nearest neighbour algorithm} to reduce the workload, and also in anticipation of a potential iterative solution to solve the \acrshort{VRP}, for which it would be essential to improve on \acrshort{TSP} solving time. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to implement an iterative solution. This final stage has therefore a time complexity of $O(CN^2)$.\par
Globally, this iteration has a total time complexity of $O(C(|E|+|V|) \log |V| + C N^2)$, where, similarly to \hyperref[iterations-1]{iteration I}, stage \ref{itm:iterations-3} has the most significant impact in terms of performance.

\section{Iteration III} \label{iterations-3}
Iteration III was not implemented due to the limited time we had left to work on this project when compared to its high level of perceived complexity, which would not only require excessive source code modifications, but would also have a very small contribution towards understanding of fundamental problem-solving approaches, techniques and algorithmics, since it is mostly a matter of adding more restrictions.
